# How to Contribute
We're very glad you've decided to help contribute. Here are a couple of guidelines to get you started.

## 1. Before the deadline, no help accepted
While we'd love to get more help, this will be part of a competition, so we can't accept issues, PRs, or any kind of contribution from anyone outside the @We-Have-No-Gameplay/Game-Jam-Dev-Team!
As soon as the deadline passes, we'd be happy to accept your assistance!

## 2. Read our dev guides!
Our dev guides can be found in [Developer Bulletins](https://github.com/We-Have-No-Gameplay/game-jam-game/discussions/categories/developer-bulletins). They provide guidelines on how our repo operates!

## 3. Ask for help!
Feel free to reach out in an issue or discussion if you need further help!
