# game-jam-game
An isometric game in Godot 4.5.1, for the 2025 DCGS Game Jam, of the theme: "Old and New". The final submission date is Monday the 8th December 2025. 
It is currently nameless, and mostly code-less.
Likely to contain beautiful pixel art graphics courtesy of @Drygith, wonderful lighting courtesy of @HippoProgrammer, decent-ish level design courtesy of @Goldenfootie, and absolutely zero gameplay, story, or replayability.

Current plans:
*Mountain climbing
*Puzzles
*Potential swimming, TBD puzzle mechanics and storyline

Current code:
*It might, maybe, at some point, potentially render objects
